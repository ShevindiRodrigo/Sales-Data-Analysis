## Problem overview
BIA Inc. is a leading sales company in Australia. It has numerous branches and offices spread
out across the nation.
The Newcastle branch's sales performance, however, has slipped. The possibility that this was
due to the branch's salespeople performing below average was raised by the head sales
executive. To find the best performing salesperson to inspire the staff, analysis should be started
in this regard.
The company's failure to maintain a database to centrally store the information is yet another
issue. They consequently lack an effective way to monitor sales performance, revenue data,
and customer transaction behavior.
As a result, the following analysis should be carried out to analyze the raw data of recent sales
in order to create a database, so that we can find solutions for the best performing salesperson,
suggestions for increasing the revenue, customer transaction behavior, and etc.
